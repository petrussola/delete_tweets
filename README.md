# delete_tweets

This is my first Ruby script â€” thanks Onemonth.com & Learn Ruby The Hard Way!

It requires:

1. Twitter Ruby wrapper https://github.com/sferik/twitter
2. That you download your file with Tweets from your Twitter account settings https://twitter.com/settings/account (Content > Your Tweet archive). Save it as 'tweets.csv' in same folder as script
3. Keep only column A of csv file and get rid of first row.
